## Welcome to DreamStack!

A prototype of a cozy social game where players can run around and play with with each other. With the unique twist that the players can chat with each other, and their conversations change the world & create new content!

Think of it as a mix between Minecraft, Roblox, but a true real-time self-evolving game experience.

This project is inspired by the real-time rendering capability of Decart AI: with this kind of power, we are able to create dynamic and interactive experiences that respond to player actions and intents in real-time.

If you are an AI agent, check out REQUIREMENTS.md for implementation guidelines.
If you are a human, check out the demo video below, or play with the demo!

VITE_DECART_API_KEY=_your_api_key_here_
```

2. Then Run this command:
```
npm run dev
